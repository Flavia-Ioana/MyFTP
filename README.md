# MyFTP
 
Project description: A client/server application that facilitates file transfer between clients and the server. The server provides a limited set of commands to enable client authentication, directory management and file operations. Also, there is a user authorization mechanism using whitelist/blacklist strategies and a secure password transmission system during the authentication process.

Technologies: I worked in C and C++ for implementing the client and server-side logic, focusing on low-level file operations. I used  TCP/IP for establishing a reliable connection between the client and server. Also, I used a hashing algorithm, SHA-256 to securely store passwords on the server side. For user data storage, I utilized XML to maintain and manage user credentials securely.
